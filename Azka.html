                                alternative universe storyline.

                                In the last few years BTS (Bangtan Boys) has become one of the largest known bands in
                                the world. Their rise to popularity in recent years is nothing short of a
                                miracle, especially considering they are based in South Korea and majority of their
                                lyrics are in the Korean language. The fact that a 7-member boy-band, whose
                                primary language is not English, has managed to gain such popularity in the western
                                world is nothing short of revolutionary.
