Their work also often references literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline.

                                        In the last few years BTS (Bangtan Boys) has become one of the largest known bands in the world. Their rise to popularity in recent years is nothing short of a 
                                        miracle, especially considering they are based in South Korea and majority of their lyrics are in the Korean language. The fact that a 7-member boy-band, whose 
                                        primary language is not English, has managed to gain such popularity in the western world is nothing short of revolutionary.
